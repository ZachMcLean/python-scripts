# Minesweeper in python

# Your task is to write a Python program that will allow someone to play a 
# text-based Minesweeper game in the terminal. Your program only needs to 
# implement a basic 5x5 board with 4 mines randomly placed.It should be fully 
# playable and include flagging as a feature. After winning or losing, your program should
# display the entire board uncovered and write out, to a separate text file, that full board uncovered, 
# and the list of moves made by the user.
